# bigo 0.0.1

* This is the initial release of `bigo`.  It is my first ever released R package and I am thankful to the R community for creating so many helpful resources, including the `devtools` package, and for the many high-quality existing packages, especially the ones in the `tidyverse`, which I used as a template for building my package, its documentation, etc.
* The next release will incorporate `num_runs` functionality in `bigo::bigo`, which will smooth out runtime estimates by computing average runtimes over several runs.
